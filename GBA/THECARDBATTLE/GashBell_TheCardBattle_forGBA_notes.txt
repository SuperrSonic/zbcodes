~ Konjiki no Gash Bell!! The Card Battle for GBA ~ Translation Notes


0x2F = linebreak
0x20 = halfwidth space

Rest is shift-jis, though numbers can be written in ascii too.
No missing glyphs for English except characters like Ã©.

In-game tutorial sections have a different character set,
but seems to have the same amount of glyphs.

0x433? is for color codes. C4, C7 are commonly used.
C1 = black/restore
C2 = gray
C3 = light gray
C4 = blue
C5 = light blue
C6 = lighter blue
C7 = red
C8 = light red
C9 = lighter red
CA = glitchy 1
CB = glitchy 2

0x8DD900 = pointer location 60DB8D08
0x8DDB60 = original text location for "Kiyomaro-!"

B0D98D08 = just a random pointer


Currently there's no way to expand the amount of textboxes.
And with only two lines of 14 characters, there's not much space
visually to write proper translations.

However the "tutorial" dialogue sections can have up to 5 lines.
These lines can be adjusted by the linebreak code.
So for these it should be possible to fit in all text necessary.

The ROM has data at the end and there's no indication of having empty space to repoint text.
