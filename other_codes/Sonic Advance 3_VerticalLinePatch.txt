The vertical line glitch is a visual bug that happens during the normal ending scene.

The white glow beams that alternate left and right will sometimes appear as a straight line
from top to bottom of the screen if there's some timing mismatch in the hardware.

As such it only happens in certain emulators and things like GBARunner2.

See: https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba/issues/503

I've made a patch that hides the line effect to solve the issue.

Search for these bytes in any version of the ROM:
0028 0AD0 3002 3C1C 0019

Or go to 0xA70B2 in the US ROM, 0xA743A in the EU ROM, or 0xA742E in the JP ROM.

Then replace them with: 0000 0048 0000 00F00000
This is an instruction replacement that loads the value 0xF000 into r0.

Since it overwrites the conditions for the x postion of the beams it goes directly to the str code.
