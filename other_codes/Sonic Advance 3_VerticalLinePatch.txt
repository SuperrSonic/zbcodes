The vertical line glitch is a visual bug that happens during the normal ending scene.

The white glow beams that alternate left and right will sometimes appear as a straight line
from top to bottom of the screen if there's some timing mismatch in the hardware.

As such it only happens in certain emulators and things like GBARunner2.

See: https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba/issues/503

I've made a patch that hides the line effect to solve the issue.

Search for these bytes in any version of the ROM:
0028 0AD0 3002 3C1C 0019

Or go to 0xA70B2 in the US ROM, 0xA743A in the EU ROM, or 0xA742E in the JP ROM.

Then replace them with: 0000 0048 0000 00F00000
This is an instruction replacement that loads the value 0xF000 into r0.
Since it overwrites the conditions for the x postion of the beams it goes directly to the str code.


Virtual Console differences:
1. Replaces the way a condition is evaluated to call a function by using svc #6. This makes the shield items to flash less.
In the original game, when a character has a shield the character sprite displays for 2 frames before switching to the shield sprite for 2 more frames.
The VC patch makes it so that the shield sprite takes 4 frames instead of 2.
The actual purpose is unclear but it can be assumed that by reducing the frequency there's less chance the shield's repetitive motion could cause image retention.

2. It lowers the value at 0xA7600 (0x0F to 0x05), reducing the white screen flashes during the normal ending scene, right after the master emerald starts shining.
To copy this change for the US ROM go to 0xA7284, or 0xA760C for the EU ROM.
