Increase limit of gained Skill Points from 500 to 800.
JP ROM:
0x44DE4 = C820 8000


No checksum, this is tricky because save is initialized as 0xFF, so if the game
loads the save as 0x1000 0xFFs it will just break. Instead, the checksum function
which is only used twice in the code, always returns 0xFEFFFFFF.

JP ROM:
0x219C8 = 12E0 //branch to exit makes checksum always 0xFEFFFFFF

No save encryption
0x218D0 = 00000000 //de-mangling
0x217A0 = 00000000 //mangling
