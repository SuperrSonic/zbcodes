- Sonic Pinball Party -

In low accuracy emulators, resuming arcade mode after a fresh boot hangs the game
for around 2 minutes. It hangs on a loop that's supposed to set some values to 0.

Skipping this loop, the game resumes correctly and I couldn't notice any wrong behavior.

More testing is needed, there is potential to branch here.

(US ROM) at 0x459B = 0xD1 change it to 0xDB to return.
